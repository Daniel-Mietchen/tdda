Constraints
===========

The :py:mod:`~tdda.constraints` module provides support for
constraint generation and verification for datasets, including
CSV files and Pandas DataFrames.

The module includes:

* A :ref:`tdda_command_line_tool` for discovering constraints in data
  from various sources, and for verifying data against those constraints,
  using the ``.tdda`` :ref:`tdda_json_file_format`.
* A Python library :py:mod:`~tdda.constraints` containing classes that
  implement constraint discovery and validation, for use from within
  other Python programs.
* Python implementations of constraint discovery and verification for a
  number of data sources:

  - CSV files
  - Pandas and R DataFrames saved as ``.feather`` files
  - PostgreSQL database tables
  - MySQL database tables
  - Sqlite database tables
  - Mongodb document collections

Python Prerequisites
--------------------

* :py:mod:`pandas` (required for CSV files and :py:mod:`feather` files)
* :py:mod:`feather-format` (required for :py:mod:`feather` files)
* :py:mod:`pygresql` (required for PostgreSQL database tables)
* :py:mod:`mysql` (required for MySQL database tables)

These can be installed with::

    pip install numpy
    pip install pandas
    pip install feather-format
    pip install pygresql
    pip install mysql-python

The :py:mod:`sqlite3` module is provided by default as part of the
standard Python libraries, so Sqlite database tables can be used without
having to explicitly install it.

To install :py:mod:`feather-format` on Windows, you will need to install
:py:mod:`cython` as a prerequisite, which might also require you to install
the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler for python, from http://aka.ms/vcpython27.

.. _tdda_command_line_tool:

Command-line Tool
-----------------

The ``tdda`` command-line utility provides a tool for discovering constraints
in data and saving them as a ``.tdda`` file using the
:ref:`tdda_json_file_format`, and also for verifying constraints in
data against a previously prepared ``.tdda`` file.

It also provides some other functionality to help with using the tool.
It takes commands in the following forms:

* :ref:`tdda_discover_tool` to perform constraint discovery.
* :ref:`tdda_verify_tool` to verify data against constraints.
* ``tdda examples`` to copy example data and code where you can see them.
* ``tdda help`` to show help on how to use the tool.
* ``tdda test`` to run the TDDA library's internal tests.

.. _tdda_discover_tool:

*tdda discover*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discover TDDA constraints for CSV files, and for Pandas or R DataFrames saved
as :py:mod:`feather` files, and save the generated constraints as a
:ref:`tdda_json_file_format` file.

Usage::

    tdda discover [FLAGS] input [constraints.tdda]

where

  * *input* is one of:

    - a csv file
    - a :py:mod:`feather` file containing a DataFrame, with extension
      ``.feather``
    - a database table name
    - a schema-qualified table name of the form *schema*.*table*
    - a database table name qualified by database type, of the
      form *dbtype*:*table* or *dbtype*:*schema*.*table*

  * *constraints.tdda*, if provided, specifies the name of a file to
    which the generated constraints will be written.

  * supported flags are

    - -r or --rex    to include regular expression generation
    - -R or --norex  to exclude regular expression generation

See :ref:`tdda_csv_file` for details of how a CSV file is read.

See :ref:`tdda_db_table` for details of how database tables are accessed.

.. _tdda_verify_tool:

*tdda verify*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verify CSV files, or for Pandas or R DataFrames saved as :py:mod:`feather`
files, against a constraints from a :ref:`tdda_json_file_format` constraints
file.

Usage::

    tdda verify [FLAGS] input [constraints.tdda]

where:

* *input* is one of:

  - a csv file
  - a :py:mod:`feather` file containing a DataFrame, with extension
    ``.feather``
  - a database table name
  - a schema-qualified table name of the form *schema*.*table*
  - a database table name qualified by database type, of the
    form *dbtype*:*table* or *dbtype*:*schema*.*table*

* *constraints.tdda*, if provided, is a JSON *.tdda* file
  constaining constraints.

If no constraints file is provided and the input is a CSV or feather file,
a constraints file with the same path as the input file, but with a *.tdda*
extension, will be used.

For database tables, the constraints file parameter is mandatory.

Optional flags are:

* -a, -\-all
    Report all fields, even if there are no failures
* -f, -\-fields
    Report only fields with failures
* -c, -\-constraints
      Report only individual constraints that fail.
      Not yet implemented.
* -1, -\-oneperline
      Report each constraint failure on a separate line.
      Not yet implemented.
* -7, -\-ascii
    Report in ASCII form, without using special characters.

See :ref:`tdda_csv_file` for details of how a CSV file is read.

See :ref:`tdda_db_table` for details of how database tables are accessed.


Constraints for CSV Files and Pandas DataFrames
-----------------------------------------------

.. _tdda_csv_file:

CSV Files
~~~~~~~~~

If a CSV file is used with the ``tdda`` command-line tool, it will be
processed by the standard Pandas CSV file reader with the following settings:

* index_col             is ``None``
* infer_datetime_format is ``True``
* quotechar             is ``"``
* quoting               is :py:const:`csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL`
* escapechar            is ``\\`` (backslash)
* na_values             are the empty string, ``"NaN"``, and ``"NULL"``
* keep_default_na       is ``False``

Constraints for Databases
-------------------------

.. _tdda_db_table:

Database Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a database table is used with the ``tdda`` command-line tool, it will be
processed by using the following optional flags to specify the database
connection details:

* -conn FILE
    Database connection file
* -dbtype DBTYPE
    Type of database
* -db DATABASE
    Name of database to connect to
* -host HOSTNAME
    Name of server to connect to
* -port PORTNUMBER
    IP port number to connect to
* -user USERNAME
    Username to connect as
* -password PASSWORD  Password to authenticate with

If ``-conn`` is provided, then none of the other options are required, and
the database connection details are read from the specified file.

If the database type is specified (with the ``-dbtype`` option, or by
prefixing the table name, such as ``postgresql:mytable``), then a default
connection file ``.tdda_db_conn_dbtype`` (in your home directory) is used,
if present.

Database Connection Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database connection information can be stored in a ``tdda_db_conn`` file.

This is a JSON file of the form::

    {
        "dbtype": DBTYPE,
        "db": DATABASE,
        "host": HOSTNAME,
        "port": PORTNUMBER,
        "user": USERNAME,
        "password": PASSWORD
    }

All the entries are optional.

If a ``password`` is provided, then care should be taken to ensure that the
file has appropriate filesystem permissions so that it cannot be read by
other users.

A database connection file ``.tdda_db_conn``, in your home directory, is used,
if it exists.  If you have specified a database type on the command line
as a parameter to the ``tdda verify`` or ``tdda discover`` commands, but no
other details, then a database connection file ``.tdda_db_conn_DBTYPE`` is
used (where ``DBTYPE`` is the database type, in lower case).

Any other database-related options passed in on the command line will
override the default settings from the connection file.
