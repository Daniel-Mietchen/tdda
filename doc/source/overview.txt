Overview
========

The :py:mod:`tdda` package provides Python support for
test-driven data analysis
(see `1-page summary <http://StochasticSolutions.com/>`_
 with references, or the `blog <http://tdda.info>`_

The :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` library is used to support the creation of
*reference tests,*
based on either :py:mod:`unittest` or :py:mod:`pytest`.

The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` library is used to *discover* constraints
from a (Pandas) DataFrame, write them out as JSON, and to *verify* that
datasets meet the constraints in the constraints file.
There are also a command-line utilities for discovering and verifying
constriants.

The :py:mod:`tdda.rexpy` library is a tool for automatically
inferring regular expressions from a column in a Pandas DataFrame
or from a (Python) list examples.
Again, there is also a command-line utility for Rexpy.
