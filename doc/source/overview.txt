Overview
========

The :py:mod:`tdda` package provides Python support for
test-driven data analysis.

The :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` library is used to support the creation of
reference tests, based on either :py:mod:`unittest` or :py:mod:`pytest`.

The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` library is used to *discover* constraints
from a (``Pandas``) DataFrame, write them out as JSON, and to *verify* that
datasets meet the constraints in the constraints file.

The :py:mod:`tdda.rexpy`` library is a tool for automatically
inferring regular expressions from a single field of data examples.
