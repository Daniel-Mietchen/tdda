The :py:mod:`tdda.rexpy` module includes a set of examples.

To copy these examples to your own *rexpy-examples* subdirectory
(or to a location of your choice)::

    python -m tdda.rexpy.examples [mydirectory]

But it is easiest to copy *all* the TDDA examples (for all of its packages)
with the command::

    tdda examples
